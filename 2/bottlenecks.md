# Bottlenecks
- Bottlenecks is a point of congestion in a production system (such as an assembly line or a computer network) that stops or everely slows a system.
- Often create delays and higher production costs
## Types of bottlenecks
### Software
- When a single components retricts the well function of the system
- Normally happens by coding mistakes or unsatisfactory logical flow in the design
### Hardware
- When there is a performance gap between hardware. For xample, a GPU beeing better than the CPU which causes the CPU to become overloaded
- We can surpass this bottleneck by upgrading CPU and RAM
### Network
- When there is a huge congestion in network flow, due to high volume of network traffic
- Happens when the bandwidth is insufficient to support all network operations
