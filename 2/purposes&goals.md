- Identify activities that need to be benchmarked(focus on processes that can give competitive edge to the business)
- This activities normally have: high cost, volume or value
- Think about how the results of benchmarking should be collected, which inputs and outputs we desire and find ways to measure it that can be comparable: choose the write metrics
