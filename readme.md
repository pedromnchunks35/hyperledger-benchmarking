# Benchmarking hyperledger fabric roadmap 
## 1. Technology Fundamentals: [+Info](./1/readme.md)
- Blockchain Concepts: Understand the basics of blockchain technology, including how distributed ledgers work, consensus algorithms, smart contracts, and transaction flow.

## 2. Benchmarking Concepts: [+Info](./2/readme.md)
- Purpose and Goals: Familiarize yourself with the reasons behind benchmarking, such as performance evaluation, optimization, and comparing alternatives.
- Metrics: Learn about the key performance metrics used in benchmarking, such as throughput (transactions per second), latency (transaction confirmation time), resource utilization, and scalability.
- Workload: Understand the concept of workload and how it represents the activities and transactions that are being tested.
- Bottlenecks: Learn to identify performance bottlenecks and constraints that limit the system's capabilities.
- Baseline: Know the importance of establishing a baseline performance to measure improvements against.

## 3. Tools and Methods:
- Benchmarking Tools: Familiarize yourself with benchmarking tools commonly used in your domain. For Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Caliper is a widely used tool for blockchain benchmarking.
- Test Scenarios: Understand how to design realistic test scenarios that represent real-world usage patterns and user behavior.

## 4. Experimental Design:
- Controlled Experiments: Learn about the principles of controlled experiments and how to set up controlled environments for accurate testing.

## 5. Data Collection and Interpretation:
- Data Collection: Understand how to collect accurate and consistent data during benchmarking runs. This includes instrumenting the system for performance metrics.
- Interpretation: Learn to interpret the collected data to draw meaningful conclusions about system performance.
